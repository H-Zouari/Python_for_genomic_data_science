## **OVERVIEW**


>


### **1.	PROJECT BACKGROUND**

The aim is to Write a Python program that takes as input a file containing DNA sequences in multi-FASTA format, and computes different analyses.

### **2.	PROJECT REQUIREMENTS**

* How many records are in the file? What are the lengths of the sequences in the file? What is the longest sequence and what is the shortest sequence? Is there more than one longest or shortest sequence? What are their identifiers?

* What is the length of the longest ORF in the file? What is the identifier of the sequence containing the longest ORF? For a given sequence identifier, what is the longest ORF contained in the sequence represented by that identifier? What is the starting position of the longest ORF in the sequence that contains it? The position should indicate the character number in the sequence.

* A repeat is a substring of a DNA sequence that occurs in multiple copies (more than one) somewhere in the sequence. Although repeats can occur on both the forward and reverse strands of the DNA sequence, we will only consider repeats on the forward strand here. Also we will allow repeats to overlap themselves. For example, the sequence ACACA contains two copies of the sequence ACA - once at position 1 and once at position 3. Given a length n, your program should be able to identify all repeats of length n in all sequences in the FASTA file. Your program should also determine how many times each repeat occurs in the file, and which is the most frequent repeat of a given length.
